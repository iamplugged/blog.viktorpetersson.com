Hello folks, Viktor here! I’m thrilled to bring two exciting updates to you all today.
First, let’s talk about my new project, <span class="underline">“Nerding Out with Viktor,”
</span> a video podcast whereI dive into riveting tech discussions with experts from various fields. The first
episode
features a deep dive into Cloud Native security with Andrew Martin from ControlPlane. We
cover a range of topics, including ethical hacking and cybersecurity strategies. It’s a real
treat for anyone keen on tech and security. You can catch the podcast on platforms like<span
class="underline">Apple
Podcasts, Spotify,</span> and <span class="underline">YouTube</span>. Make sure to subscribe and join in on the
conversation!<br><br>
Also, I’m excited to introduce the <span class="underline">Podcast RSS Generator,</span> a tool I developed for
podcasters
(or rather, for myself). It’s designed to generate RSS feeds for audio/video podcasts, especially
useful for those using S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudflare R2 for hosting. This tool stands
out in its field, being possibly the first of its kind and is even featured in the GitHub Actions
Marketplace. It’s adaptable to various storage solutions, making it a versatile choice for podcast
creators. Check it out in the <span class="underline">GitHub Actions Marketplace.</span>
<br><br>
Stay tuned for more exciting episodes and updates on these projects! Your support and feedback are
always appreciated. Let’s keep nerding out together!
