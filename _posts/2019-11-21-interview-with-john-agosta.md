### Tell me a bit more about yourself.

I’m an old school software developer.  By that I mean, I started software development back in the days of mainframe computing; Fortran, C, assembler, and when 256K was a lot of memory, and 10MB was a large disk. I originally thought I would be an architect designing the next generation residential homes.  Little did I envision that the architecture I ended up loving more would utilize computer software building blocks. Over my three decade career I have stayed in the software development field as a developer, product manager, and deliver manager.

### How long have you been working remotely?

For 8 ½ years.

### Where are you based out of?

Steamboat Springs, Colorado a small Colorado ski town.

### Can you describe your home setup?

I have a sit/stand desk.  It is of decent size. It has a manual control that allows me to very quickly adjust height. I have a Herman Miller ergo chair for when sitting and a foot pad for when standing. I also have my desk next to a large window that overlooks the mountains. I have a 15” laptop that is connected to a docking station connected to a large monitor, external ergo friendly keyboard and mouse. I only use a single monitor, but do use my laptop screen as a second display.

### What are some characteristics of a well functioning remote team?

Characteristics of a well functioning co-located team and a remote team are very similar.  Where they diverge is probably more in the levels of clarity communication.  Communication is core to every aspect of the team characteristic.

* Business clear direction and goals
  * Organization leaders need to understand that they need to provide clear set of directions.  This allows for team members at all levels to make important decisions at their levels and not wait for answers.
* Strong open communication
  * Every member of the team needs to be both a good listener and comfortable contributing to discussions.
* Self motivated
  * There is no one looking over your shoulder to see that you are at your desk working.  Remote workers need the ability to focus on the required business tasks
* Ability to shutdown
  * If you sleep and work in the same place it can be difficult to know when to quit.  Where brick and mortar managers worry their staff are not working if they cannot see them working.  Remote managers need to be concerned that their employees are not burning out by beings always on.
* Good collaboration tools
  * Chat tool:  All employees -- at all levels (even CEO) -- need to be online, and active in a company wide messaging.  This is your legs when you need to stop by someone’s desk to ask a quick question.  Or this is a place where coffee station discussion turns into an extended brainstorm or technical discussion with decisions. I am not particular to any one chat tool as long as I can search chat archives for previous discussion points.
  * Video conferencing:  We are human and we thrive on contact.   Whenever possible, meetings (even this customers) should be done with live video.  We gain a lot of insight be reading the body language of others. This also forces you to get out of your pajamas and dress for work.  ;-)  I do like google hangouts because it is integrated into my google calendaring system.
  * Shared document system: a.k.a. Google docs.  Desktop editing systems just do not work for distributed teams. You collaborate in the documents.

There are some obvious omissions from this list of remote characteristics, such as great work ethics, reliability, ability to manage your time, and of course Trust. These are very, very important, but these are very, very important for any well functioning team and business.

### What's your best productivity hack for working remotely?

Actually, I can’t think of one.

### How did remote work change or impact your life?

If you have ever read one of the original career management books, “What color is your Parachute”, Richard Bolles discusses the principal around your career success and happiness starts with the foundation of being happy with where you live. You spend so much time outside of work, so everything grows from that base. So, for me, remote management has allowed me to be flexible in where I can live. So, now I live in the Colorado Rocky Mountains a resort town that features world class skiing in the winter, a world class river in the summer,  open wilderness, and also another love, many mountain biking trails.

### Other than your home base, what is your favorite place to work remotely from?

With age I have lost a lot of near field vision. So, I am not nearly as productive away from my home setup.  I also need large screens to spread out my work across my monitors (desk). So, while I do enjoy the occasional coffee shop to get away.  I only do that if I am reviewing documents and responding to emails that don’t require a lot of analysis.

### What are some habits or rituals that you do to keeps you going?

For me it is ensuring a regular schedule of biking and skiing.  For others this may just be their favorite hobby. We need something to help us refresh.  Also, ensuring you get out of your home to interface with others.

### What are your favorite tools for collaboration?

* Google suite of tools (Gdocs, hangout, calendar)
* Telegram

### What advice would you give to someone who has never worked remotely before and is about to join a remote company?

Have a routine and a schedule. Don’t let the fact that work is always “here” get in the way of the things you like away from work.  This doesn’t mean you don’t absolutely love the work you are doing. It is more that you also need to get away from “work” to refresh your mind and help you be more productive at your work.
